-----------  Flight Sim - Checklist Reader v 0.1 - by Martin Ritter ---------------------

This is an attempt to create my very own checklist reader for MS Flightsimultar. 
It does however work with any kind of sim, or even for whatever purpous you want it to.
All it does, at its current state, is vocaly call out a checklist, or any txt file presented,
line by line on the press of a game controller button.
Alternatively the progression throug the checklist can also be triggered by optional
voice recignition, on the predefined trigger word "check"

Disclaimer:
  Please note, that I am not a programmer what so ever. I just needet this tool to fly
  in VR and could not find anything that fit my needs. So I built something myself.
  Also the voice recognition is super early "alpha stage" 
  There are no guaranties that any of this works ;-)

Installation:
  There is no installation necessary. Just run the binary or if you like, run the python 
  code directly or pack it into a binary yourself. 
  For the casual user, just clicken on the .exe file should work.

Usage:
  Using the "open checklist" button, just load any .txt file into the application.
  The checklist needs to be in a simple line by line text form

  The application permanently captures all gamecontroller inputs and displays the
  captured button. By pressing the "set check button" button, you can set the last
  button captured to be your personal "checklist button"
